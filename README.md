Some problems faced by individuals:
Drug-to-Drug Interactions: One of the common medical issues patient faces is the risk of harmful drug-to-drug interactions. When patients take multiple medications, there's a chance that these drugs may react with each other in ways that reduce efficacy or even cause dangerous side effects. This is especially challenging when patients see multiple doctors or receive treatment from different sources, as information on current medications might not always be readily available, leading to unintended interactions.
Ambiguous Medical History: Ambiguous or incomplete medical history is another significant problem. When patients switch healthcare providers or seek emergency care, essential details about their past treatments, allergies, and previous diagnoses may not be fully available, causing gaps in the information needed for accurate diagnosis and treatment. This lack of continuity can lead to misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatments, and a delay in addressing critical health issues.
Delay in Case of Emergencies: In emergencies, quick and informed decisions are crucial. However, delays can occur if there’s a lack of immediate access to a patient’s health data or if they need to wait for specialized medical assistance. Such delays can be life-threatening, as they prevent the rapid, coordinated care that is essential for managing critical conditions like heart attacks, strokes, or severe allergic reactions.
Pregnancy Medication Safety: Pregnant individuals face unique challenges regarding medication safety, as some drugs that are safe under normal conditions may pose risks during pregnancy. Without proper guidance, there’s a chance of taking medications that could harm the mother or foetus. Monitoring and regulating medication for pregnant individuals is crucial but often complicated by limited data on drug safety during pregnancy, making safe and effective medication management challenging.
 
How Aasra tackles these problems: 
Managing Drug-to-Drug Interactions: Aasra includes a feature that automatically screens for potential drug interactions. Users can enter or upload their medication details, and the app would check for any known interactions based on the most recent medical databases. It also sends alerts to both users and their healthcare providers, ensuring that any harmful combinations are identified before they cause issues, improving medication safety and reducing adverse effects.
Addressing Ambiguous Medical History: Aasra provides a centralized health record where users and healthcare providers can document medical history, diagnoses, allergies, and previous treatments. By offering a secure, accessible digital repository of health records, the app allows users to share accurate medical history with new healthcare providers seamlessly. This solution ensures that healthcare professionals have a comprehensive understanding of each user’s background, supporting better-informed medical decisions and reducing gaps in care.
Reducing Delays in Emergencies: For emergency situations, Aasra features an “Emergency Alert” that users can activate to share critical health information, such as allergies, medications, and conditions, with emergency responders quickly. The app also has an emergency contact feature, sending real-time alerts with location details to designated contacts. Additionally, Aasra integrates with local emergency services to provide quicker, informed support and help reduce response times, potentially saving lives.
Safe Pregnancy Medication Management: To support safe medication use during pregnancy, Aasra offers a pregnancy-specific medication tracker and guidance system. This feature flags any medications that are contraindicated during pregnancy and suggest safer alternatives, providing warnings and recommendations based on official medical guidelines. The app also connects users to healthcare providers specializing in prenatal care for consultation, supporting expectant mothers with safer, well-informed medication decisions.
Muse Bot: An AI-driven virtual assistant designed to answer basic medical questions and provide health-related information. Utilizing natural language processing and machine learning, Muse Bot interprets user inquiries and deliver accurate, reliable responses based on a vast database of medical knowledge. This makes it a valuable resource for individuals seeking quick answers regarding general health advice.
"Take Your Medicine" notification system: It is a feature that helps users manage their medication schedules by sending timely reminders when it's time to take prescribed medications. Users can input details like dosage and timing, and the app delivers personalized notifications via push alerts, texts, or emails. This system includes features for logging medication intake, alerting users to refill prescriptions, and providing educational resources about each medication, ultimately supporting better adherence and overall health management.
